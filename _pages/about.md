Hello!
I am a PostDoc at ‘Economics of Technology and Innovation’ (TU Delft). I am interested in managerial and strategic aspects of technological innovations, specifically platform ecosystems.
I seek to understand platform-complementor dynamics with respect to the platform’s positioning. My research has been published in Technovation and Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management, and Technological Forecasting and Social Change.

I teach the course Strategic Mangement Game as part of the minor Companies and Value-Sensitive Innovation. 

I hold a PhD from Delft Univerisity of Technology, a M.Sc. in Management of Technology, and a B.Eng. in Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering.

#Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
